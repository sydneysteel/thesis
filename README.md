This interactive application can be used to evaluate the percentage of women in management positions across 14 different countries from 2008 to 2017.

The data can be explored in a scatterplot, and linear regression model. These different lenses are intended to highlight the cross-national variations in the percentage of women managers as well as its interactions with several other social indicators.
